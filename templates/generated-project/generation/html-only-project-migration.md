# HTML-Only Project Migration

Use this when the input is a standalone HTML/CSS/JS project but the user needs
usage logging, analytics, user-action review, persistence, auth, or multi-user
visibility.

## Required approach

1. Migrate the UI into `frontend/` as React + TypeScript + Vite.
2. Preserve the product behavior and copy visual intent into plain CSS with BEM.
3. Add the fixed backend under `backend/`: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x, Maven
   multi-module, PostgreSQL, Liquibase, and contract-first OpenAPI.
4. Expose a backend ingestion path for explicit UI events when click/action
   review is required, normally `POST /api/v1/usage-events`.
5. Persist sanitized events to PostgreSQL `usage_events`; never rely on
   browser-only console logs or `localStorage` analytics for centralized review.
6. If the UI logs actions explicitly through the endpoint, set
   `app.usage-logging.enabled: false` (or default
   `USAGE_LOGGING_ENABLED=false`) so the AOP/service auto-logger does not create
   duplicate rows for the same user action. The explicit endpoint should write
   through the usage event sink directly.
7. Package the Vite build into the Spring Boot jar for Replit deployment: one
   public port, Spring Boot serves `/api/*` and the SPA.

## Forbidden fallbacks

- Single-file/static-only output when centralized usage review is needed.
- Node/Express, Python/Flask/Django, serverless-only, or static-only substitutes.
- Console-only logging, local-only logs, or browser-only analytics storage.
- A custom layout that differs from the generated `backend/` and `frontend/`
  structure.
