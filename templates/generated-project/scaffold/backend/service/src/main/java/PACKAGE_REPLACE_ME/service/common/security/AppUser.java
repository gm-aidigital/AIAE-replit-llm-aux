 * Immutable caller context passed through the service layer.

 * an opt-in extension — if the product needs role-based authorization, add a
 * separate {@code roles} field here keyed by the stable {@code userId}.
 *
 * @param userId    Stable Clerk user id — the {@code user_id} claim (equals {@code sub}).
 * @param email     Lowercased canonical email from the {@code email} claim.
 * @param fullName  Display name from the {@code full_name} claim, falling back to email.
