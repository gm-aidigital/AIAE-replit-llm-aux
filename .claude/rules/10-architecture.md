# Backend Architecture Rules

- Follow the rule `1 entity = 1 repository = 1 service to work with that entity`.
- Only the paired entity service implementation may inject that entity's repository.
- Cross-entity services and query services must depend on entity services, not repositories.
- Cross-entity query/administration orchestration belongs in the service layer
  and must not become a repository hub.
- Controllers never inject repositories.
- Outbound HTTP/SDK integrations live in `backend/external-services` only.
- Third-party Spring HTTP clients use the shared `PooledRestClientFactory`; the
  resulting client must register both `ExternalClientMetricsInterceptor` and
  `LogbookClientHttpRequestInterceptor`. SDK-managed calls use the reusable
  `ExternalCallTimer` from `backend/observability`.
- Database transactions do not span third-party HTTP/SDK calls, object storage,
  AI work, file transfer, polling, sleeps, or other slow I/O.
- BigQuery SDK clients live in `backend/external-services`, while BigQuery SQL construction lives in `service` through a typed, whitelisted request builder. Follow `templates/generated-project/integrations/bigquery-query-rules.md`: one configured builder emits both the paged data query and the matching count query over the same `WHERE` clause; user input never supplies table names, columns, predicates, field lists, or order expressions.
- If a new query primarily loads or locks one entity, place it in that entity repository and expose it through that entity service.
- If service logic grows complex, extract validator/policy/helper collaborators instead of adding another private-method cluster.
