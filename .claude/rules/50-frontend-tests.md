# Frontend Test Rules

- Use Vitest and Testing Library.
- Test names use `should ...` phrasing.
- Structure tests with `// Given:`, `// When:`, and `// Then:`.
- Keep behavior setup inside each test; avoid common mutable fixtures.
- Shared typed DTO factories are allowed, but tests must override behavior-relevant fields locally.
- Prefer explicit assertions and captured calls over loose matchers.
- Reset mocks between tests when module-level mocks are used.
- Cover loading, error, empty, and success states for server-backed surfaces.
- Cover critical user actions with success and validation/error cases.
- When changing query ownership, caching, navigation, dialogs, tabs, or mutations, assert important request counts and verify that rerenders do not produce duplicate requests.
- Cover cache invalidation boundaries for successful mutations and user/session changes when those behaviors are affected.
- Do not use snapshot-only tests as meaningful coverage.
